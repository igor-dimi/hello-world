## About
Hi, I go with different names, PlusMinus, TheIkarus, Dimi, RuuS and many others.
This GitHub account will consist of my personal projects as I navigate my way around the vast field of CS.
There will be repos intented simply for learning a language and will contain simple exercises. Others will have more serious ambitions, like containing long-term software projects. 

A web-site or a blog talking about the fundamentals of various CS Topics in a very intuitive and insightful way is among the plans, as I have came to realize that core and profound understanding is usually concealed from the newcomers to CS and programming. 

Take care and stay tuned.
